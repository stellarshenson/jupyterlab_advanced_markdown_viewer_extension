# Integration Testing

This folder contains the integration tests of the extension.

They are defined using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) test runner
and [Galata](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/main/galata) helper.

The Playwright configuration is defined in [playwright.config.js](./playwright.config.js).

The JupyterLab server configuration to use for the integration test is defined
in [jupyter_server_test_config.py](./jupyter_server_test_config.py).

The default configuration will produce video for failing tests and an HTML report.

> There is a UI mode that you may like; see [that video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF0yA-JLQW0).

## Run the tests

> All commands are assumed to be executed from the root directory

To run the tests, you need to:

1. Compile the extension:

```sh
jlpm install
jlpm build:prod
```

> Check the extension is installed in JupyterLab.

2. Install test dependencies (needed only once):

```sh
cd ./ui-tests
jlpm install
jlpm playwright install
cd ..
```

3. Execute the [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) tests:

```sh
cd ./ui-tests
jlpm playwright test
```

Test results will be shown in the terminal. In case of any test failures, the test report
will be opened in your browser at the end of the tests execution; see
[Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters#html-reporter)
for configuring that behavior.

## Update the tests snapshots

> All commands are assumed to be executed from the root directory

If you are comparing snapshots to validate your tests, you may need to update
the reference snapshots stored in the repository. To do that, you need to:

1. Compile the extension:

```sh
jlpm install
jlpm build:prod
```

> Check the extension is installed in JupyterLab.

2. Install test dependencies (needed only once):

```sh
cd ./ui-tests
jlpm install
jlpm playwright install
cd ..
```

3. Execute the [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) command:

```sh
cd ./ui-tests
jlpm playwright test -u
```

> Some discrepancy may occurs between the snapshots generated on your computer and
> the one generated on the CI. To ease updating the snapshots on a PR, you can
> type `please update playwright snapshots` to trigger the update by a bot on the CI.
> Once the bot has computed new snapshots, it will commit them to the PR branch.

## Create tests

> All commands are assumed to be executed from the root directory

To create tests, the easiest way is to use the code generator tool of playwright:

1. Compile the extension:

```sh
jlpm install
jlpm build:prod
```

> Check the extension is installed in JupyterLab.

2. Install test dependencies (needed only once):

```sh
cd ./ui-tests
jlpm install
jlpm playwright install
cd ..
```

3. Start the server:

```sh
cd ./ui-tests
jlpm start
```

4. Execute the [Playwright code generator](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen) in **another terminal**:

```sh
cd ./ui-tests
jlpm playwright codegen localhost:8888
```

## Debug tests

> All commands are assumed to be executed from the root directory

To debug tests, a good way is to use the inspector tool of playwright:

1. Compile the extension:

```sh
jlpm install
jlpm build:prod
```

> Check the extension is installed in JupyterLab.

2. Install test dependencies (needed only once):

```sh
cd ./ui-tests
jlpm install
jlpm playwright install
cd ..
```

3. Execute the Playwright tests in [debug mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/debug):

```sh
cd ./ui-tests
jlpm playwright test --debug
```

## Upgrade Playwright and the browsers

To update the web browser versions, you must update the package `@playwright/test`:

```sh
cd ./ui-tests
jlpm up "@playwright/test"
jlpm playwright install
```

## Waiting

A test may wait for a condition. It must never race a production window.

A fixed sleep standing in for something that is observable is the defect this rule exists
for: it fails when the machine is loaded, it is slow when the machine is not, and the
failure says nothing about the behaviour under test. Wait for the condition instead -
`expect(locator)`, `expect.poll(...)`, `page.waitForFunction` - all of which converge as
fast as the machine allows and cannot be outrun by load.

Three shapes, and what each one must do:

- **Waiting for something to happen** - wait for it, never for a duration long enough to
  contain it
- **Separating two stimuli that must land inside a window** - set the window, never hope
  about the gap. A sleep names a floor and never a ceiling, so a 50 ms gap against a 100 ms
  window is decided by the load and not by the code. Where the window is a plugin setting,
  `settings({ ... })` sets it; where it is a server constant, pytest reaches it with
  `monkeypatch.setattr`
- **Waiting to show that something did not happen** - a duration is the only way, since a
  non-event cannot be waited for. Derive it from the window the mechanism itself uses, say
  in a comment which window that is, and keep it far enough past it that the answer does
  not turn on the machine

Where a layer cannot reach the window it would have to race - a browser test against a
server constant - the timing claim belongs to the layer that can set it, and the browser
case asserts the settled state, which no gap can change. `events.spec.ts` 'settles on the
last write of a burst' and `test_routes.py` `test_burst_writes_coalesce` are that split.
